# People-detection-tracking-and-counting
Object detection and tracking is implemented using YOLOv4, DeepSort and Tensorflow. YOLOv4 is a state of the art algorithm that uses deep convolutional neural networks to perform object detections. The output of YOLOv4 is fed into Deep SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric) in order to create a highly accurate object tracker. Counters are implemented to count the total number of unique people throughout the video and using a reference line, the number of people passing from left to right is counted.

During execution, the video shows the tracking of each person(bounding box) with their respective IDâ€™s. The Unique Person count in the entire video and the count of people moving from left to right is displayed in the terminal after the execution.

Libraries Used : OpenCV, TensorFlow, Numpy, Pillow


     To Execute the code - Run the following commands in Terminal/Command Prompt :
1) python save_model.py --weights ./data/yolov4-tiny.weights --output ./checkpoints/yolov4- tiny-416 --input_size 416 --model yolov4 --tiny
2) python track_objects.py --weights ./checkpoints/yolov4-tiny-416 --score 0.3 --video ./data/ test.mp4 --model yolov4
